=head1 NAME

Apache::SiteControl::GrantAllRule - A rule that grants permission to do everything.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

In your instance of a ManagerFactory:

=over 4

   use Apache::SiteControl::GrantAllRule;
   ...

   sub getPermissionManager
   {
      ...

      $manager->addRule(new Apache::SiteControl::GrantAllRule);

      ...

      return $manager;
   }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Apache::SiteControl::GrantAllRule is a pre-built rule that grants access for all 
permission requests. This rule can be used to help implement a system that
has a default policy of allowing access, and to which you add rules that 
deny access for specific cases.

Note that the loose type checking of Perl makes this inherently dangerous, 
since a typo is likely to fail to deny access. It is recommended that you
take the opposite approach with your rules, since a typo will err on the 
side of denying access. The former is a security hole, the latter is a bug
that people complain about (so you can fix it).
