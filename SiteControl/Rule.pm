=head1 NAME

Apache::SiteControl::Rule - Permission manager access rule.

=head2 DESCRIPTION

Each rule is a custom-written class that implements some aspect of your site's
access logic. Rules can choose to grant or deny a request. 

   package sample::Test;

   use strict;
   use warnings;
   use Carp;
   use Apache::SiteControl::Rule;

   use base qw(Apache::SiteControl::Rule);

   sub grants($$$$)
   {
      my $this = shift;
      my $user = shift;
      my $action = shift;
      my $resource = shift;

      if($action eq "edit" && $resource->isa("sample::Record")) {
         return 1 if($user{name} eq "root");
      }

      return 0;
   }

   sub denies($$$$)
   {
      return 0;
   }

   1;

The PermissionManager will only give permission if I<at least> one rule grants
permission, I<and> no rule denies it. 

It is important that your rules never grant or deny a request they do not
understand, so it is a good idea to use assertions or type checking to prevent
strangeness. B<Assertions should not be used> if you expect different rules to
accept different resource types or user types, since each rule is used on every
access request.
