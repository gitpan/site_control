WARNING: This sample is tuned for use with mod_perl 1.xx, NOT mod_perl2. Use
site2 for mod_perl2 installations.

This is a complete sample. To set it up:

1) Set up some sort of radius server (i.e. Free Radius) and add users to it.
   For this demo to be interesting, make sure you have a user named admin, or
   edit the EditControlRule.pm file and change "admin" to something
   else.
2) mkdir /tmp/sessions /tmp/session/locks
3) Edit/install the apache_sitecontrol.conf file and update the relevant fields
   (Radius info, shared secret, location mappings). 
4) Copy *.html to the /sample URI on your web server. 
   (i.e. /var/www/htdocs/sample)
5) Copy samplelogin.pl to your document root. (Also make sure .pl will get
   run by mod_perl)
6) Restart apache and check logs.
7) Try to access /sample/page.html
   - You should be sent to the login page. Login using valid radius auth
     stuff.
   - You should see the page. If you are logged in as "admin", then you
     should have editable fields. If not, you should just see data.
8) Go to /sample/logout.html
   - You should see a logout message
9) Try to access /sample/page.html again.
   - You should see the login screen again.

Debugging is turned on in the default configuration, so check error_log in 
apache if you have problems.
