# This rule is going to be used in a system that automatically grants
# permission for everything (via the GrantAllRule). So this rule will
# only worry about what to deny, and the grants method can return whatever.
# Note that writing a deny-based system is inherently more dangerous and 
# buggy because of the lack of type-safety. Typos in the HTML components can
# cause a rule to fail to deny an invalid request, which is typically less
# desirable than failing to grant a request. The former is a security hole that
# might get missed; the latter is a bug that gets quickly reported.
