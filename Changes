May 5, 2005: Version 0.42
   - Fixed bug in saving extra user credentials to session

May 1, 2005: Version 0.42
   - Changed name to Apache::SiteControl
   - Removed radius bugfix from 0.41...needs more debugging

May 1, 2005:
   - Fixed bug when passing extended credentials to check_credentials.

Apr 29, 2005: Version 0.41
   - Added the ability to pass extra "credentials" from the login page. This
     will allow you to choose alternatives (such as imap server for a webmail
     client, etc.)
   - Patched Radius.pm to include NAS IP

Apr 20, 2005: Version 0.41
   - Added ability to store password in user object. This is enabled with an
     Apache directive.
   
Mar 1, 2005: Version 0.3.1
   - Changed call to user factory so that all credentials are passed. This
     makes it possible to embed the password in the user object for things like
     pass-through logins.
   - New option to allow caching of passwords in the server side session (off
     by default for security reasons...see docs/apache)

June 7, 2004: Version 0.3
   - Now works with Apache 2/mod_perl 2 in Apache compat mode
   - Wrote sample sites for both apache 1 and 2.
   - Updated docs to reflect all the changes

June 2, 2004
   - Updated concepts of User, UserFactory
      - User now has methods for managing the session. You can add data to the
        session simply by calling $user->setAttribute(...), and you can get it
        back by calling $user->getAttribute(...)
      - Logouts are now done by simply calling $user->logout
      - UserFactory is now tightly integrated with Apache::Session::File, and
        the factory is now responsible for all persistence management.
   - Much less code need be written to start using the package. Mostly done in
     httpd.conf now. (You still need to write rules, and a permission factory
     of course).
